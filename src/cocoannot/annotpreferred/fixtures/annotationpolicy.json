[{"model": "annotpreferred.annotationpolicy", "pk": 1, "fields": {"policy": "When annotating, please stick to our annotation policy:\r\n\r\n- Only take he segmented objects into account, things that are not segmented are not there.\r\n\r\n- Given a task, first you have to locate all objects which are suitable to solve it at all (better than your bare body). After that, choose among them all objects for which there is no better one present. (E.g. you have to serve vine and there are identical mugs and identical vine glasses on the table. You have to pick all vine glasses. If there were only identical mugs but no vine glasses, you'd have to pick all mugs.)\r\n\r\n- You must not select objects which are drawn on a poster, displayed on a screen, shown in the mirror etc, i.e. only select real objects\r\n\r\n- Do not select humans or animals, they are not tools and also can not be ordered to perform actions. You are also not allowed to choose human clothes as tools if a person is wearing them.\r\n\r\n- Only care about the intrinsic properties of objects. (E.g. Ignore if the object is dirty or not, occupied or not, etc. You always assume it is non occupied and clean, i.e. ready for use)\r\n\r\n- Creativity is appreciated, as in the case with 'fishing the lemon out of very hot tea using a banana as spoon'. Yes, you can open the beer with whatever you want, knifes, forks, edges of furniture. \r\n\r\n-  If you can not clearly recognize the shape/attributes of an object, assume the least suitable shape/attributes possible. (e.g. your task is to smear butter on bread and you see a piece of cutlery in a glass of jam: assume it is a spoon/fork and not a knife and only pick it if there is no knife in this image)\r\n\r\n- If an annotation segment looks ambigous, i.e. it is not clear what object it belongs to, assume that this segment belongs to the least suitable object. (E.g. you would prefer a knife and there is a segment which could belong to a knife or a fork, assume it means the fork.)\r\n\r\n- Do not pick objects which require non reversible actions in order to make them suitable for the task. (E.g. do not plan to break a glass bottle to use it's fragments). \r\n\r\n- However, it is allowed to risk to damage the object during the task (E.g. You can pound something with a glass bottle even if you risk to break it.), although this should make the object less convenient for this.\r\n\r\n- If you can use a part of an object without breaking the object, you have to select this object. (E.g. choose the plastic bottle if you can use its cup)\r\n\r\n- Note that annotations might be not perfect (e.g. only part of object is segmented, or different parts of the object are separately segmented). You nevertheless have to choose this object (all segments of it) if it is among the best ones for this task.\r\n\r\nHint: All segmented classes belong to a COCO object class. If unsure what object is actually meant by segment, see if it is in this list http://cocodataset.org/#explore"}}]
